# SC1015-Introduction-to-Data-Science-and-Artificial-Intelligence
A mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)

## Problem Motivation
Mushroom hunting, or "shrooming", has become increasingly popular as a recreational activity. However, correctly identifying edible mushrooms from poisonous ones can be challenging, even for experienced mushroom hunters. This poses a risk to the safety of mushroom hunters and their companions, as well as the general public if contaminated mushrooms are consumed.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model for mushroom classification that classifies edible and poisonous mushrooms, enhancing the safety of mushroom hunting activities.

## Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
